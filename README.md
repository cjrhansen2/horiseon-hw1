# Horiseon Homepage

## Description

This website serves as practice for refactoring a webpage's HTML and CSS code, which is likely to be a common task in future web development jobs. This webpage acts as a main page for the fake search engine optimization company "Horiseon". In this project I focused on applying apt semantic HTML elements, linking elements on the main page to navigational links at the top of the page, using alt properties for image elements, and eliminating redundancies or poor syntax. I did my best to replace any non-semantic div elements with semantic elements like nav, aside, section, etc. This is all in order to increase the website's accessibility

## Installation

You can download the files from GitHub, open them in VS Code, and use "run from browser" to run the page from your own computer.

Alternatively, you can visit the github links I created: 
URL of deployed webpage: https://cjrhansen2.github.io/horiseon-hw1/
URL of GitHub repository: https://github.com/cjrhansen2/horiseon-hw1

## Usage

Scroll around the page and click on the links in the nav bar at the top to see how they take you to the proper sections (it's pretty cool if I say so myself).
